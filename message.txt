Steganography
Steganography is:
"the art of passing information in a manner that the very existence of the message is unknown.“
What is Steganography?
Steganography means covered or hidden writing.
The objective is to send a message through some innocuous carrier to a receiver while preventing anyone else from knowing that a message is being sent at all.
Cryptography and Steganography
Cryptography and steganography are different. 
With cryptography you know there is a message but you cant read it.
Cryptographic techniques can be used to scramble a message so that if it is discovered it cannot be read. 
Cryptography and Steganography
Unlike cryptography, steganography hides the very existence of a message so that if successful it generally attracts no suspicion at all
Uses of Steganography
Covert Communication
Civil Rights Organisations
Terrorists 
Watermarking
Storage of data in an image about the image / for searching / pay per view system
Personal information storage
ID Card
Computer Based Steganography
Computer based stenography allows changes to be made to what are known as digital carriers such as images or sounds. 
The changes represent the hidden message.
Good steganographic methods lead to little or no discernible change to the carrier. 
What’s in the Message?
The information may be nothing to do with the carrier sound or image or it might be information about the carrier such as the author or a digital watermark or digital fingerprint.
